# A local Laravel development stack

A repository containing the required üê≥ Docker images for running a portable
Laravel installation.

Laravel + Docker = ‚ù§Ô∏è

The repository contains the following software:

- php **7.3** (fpm)
- nginx **1.16** (alpine)

Volumes are mounted to directory:

- **./storage**

### Start the stack

Open a terminal and execute the following command in order to start the stack:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop the stack

In order to stop the stack execute the following command:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

### Rebuild the images

Use:

```
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

or:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

### Mount your Laravel directory

Use the following command in order to make a symbolic link of any folder
inside the container:

```
$ ln -s /path/to/your/laravel/install ./storage/www
```

You should now be able to see your Laravel installation available at:

- http://localhost

### Configuration variables used in your project

If you need access from a container to another instead of using the internal
IP addresses of the containers, you can instead use their hostnames:

- app (for the php-fpm container)
- web (for the nginx container)
- db (for the mysql container)
- pma (for the phpmyadmin container)
